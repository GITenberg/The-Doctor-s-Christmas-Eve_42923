description: In the nineteenth-century rural South, country doctors were often much
  more than just physicians. They played a part in the personal dramas, important
  milestones, and life-or-death decisions of virtually every family in a fifty-mile
  radius. In this charming novel, one such doctor reflects on his life over the past
  year as the holiday season approaches.
